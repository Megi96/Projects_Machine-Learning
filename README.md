#Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing Experiments

This repository contains a collection of small experimental projects focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning.
It serves as a personal workspace for learning, testing ideas, and building prototype models.

Each project is organized in its own directory and may include:

*Jupyter notebooks

*Preprocessing scripts

*Datasets (or links to datasets)

*Documentation and notes

The goal of this repository is to track progress, test different workflows, and build a reference library of machine-learning experiments.
